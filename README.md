# hugo-mock-landing-page-autodeployed

Custom page for Assist, a basketball connector app.

- Added a deployment script to automatically publish the website whenever a new commit change has occured. The Hugo source files are compiled and then published to the gh-pages branch. After this the changes are shown when the website is refreshed.
